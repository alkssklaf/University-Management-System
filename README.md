# University-Management-System

The university serves as a place where students pursue their education and teachers perform their duties. The university operates two types of semesters: fall and spring. Each semester, for every academic year, has a defined schedule that includes the start and end dates of classes as well as the exam period.

Students can register for various classes each semester. In some cases, a student may also assume the role of a teacher. Each student receives a result for every class they have registered for.

Classes are assigned to specific teachers for a given semester. Each class has a unique code and offers several methods of completion, such as exams, credits, or colloquiums. Upon successful completion of a class, the student earns a specified number of credits.

Every student has many digital notebook where teachers can record information. Each record in the notebook includes a title, content, the creation date, and the name of the teacher who made the entry.
